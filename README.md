# CHAGL Repository - Consonant Harmony & Artificial Grammar Learning

This repository contains code for an original research project on artificial grammar learning (AGL) of consonant harmony. 

## Purpose of Project

Consonant harmony occurs when two or more consonants in a domain (usually a word) change to match one another in some way. In this project, we investigated sibilant harmony involving the 's' and 'sh' sounds in an artificial language designed for the study. The purpose of the study was to shed light on a form of consonant harmony that has not been documented among the world's languages - prefix-controlled harmony. Prefix-controlled harmony occurs when a sibilant in a prefix triggers changes in prefixes in the stem or other parts of the word to match the triggering segment. In this project, we tested the learnability of prefix-controlled consonant harmony and three attested forms of consonant harmony to determine whether the cross-linguistic lack of prefix-controlled harmony is due to it being less learnable than competing forms. 

## Publication Information

The results have been accepted for publication in *The Journal of the Association for Laboratory Phonology* under the title "Impacts of direction and morphological locus of control on learnability of sibilant harmony". The four authors of the project are Jenna T. Conklin, Elliot Stork, Ruken Bastimar, and Xueqi He. 

## Repository Contents

This repository hosts the cleaned data set and code for models and figures from the paper; these files will also be available as through the journal as supplemental files.
